# IA-2-009 (0) Bank Account

A simple command line application. The application lets you create fictional bank accounts and interact with them. The state of the application persists across sessions. The purpose of the application is to demonstrate basic concepts in Java, such as classes and inheritance, threads and serialization.

**NOTE:** the interface of the application is in Swedish.

Made in the course "Datastrukturer och algoritmer (2019-20) (IA-2-009 (0))" at [Arcada University of Applied Sciences](https://www.arcada.fi/en "www.arcada.fi/en").

The project (repository) spans five assignments. In each assignment, a new layer of functionality is added on top of the product of the previous assignment. A release marks the product of an assignment, such that v1.0.0 is the product of the first assignment, v2.0.0 is the product of the second, and so on.
